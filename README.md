# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system built using Python. It uses user ratings and metadata to suggest movies similar to the ones provided by the user. The project leverages machine learning with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for recommendations.

## üìñ Project Description

The Movie Recommendation System takes advantage of a large dataset of user ratings and movie metadata to recommend movies based on user input. Due to the size of the dataset, it is not included in the repository. However, you can download the full datasets from Kaggle using the links provided below.
